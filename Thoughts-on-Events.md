### Per Agency
1. Direct Plot =  Frequency~t
2. Trend = Linear regress (Direct Plot )
3. Seasonality = Sine Cosine regress (Direct Plot )
4. Noise = Direct Plot/ (Trend * Seasonality)
5. Irregularity = outliers in Noise

### Inter Agency
6. Correlation = correlation (time of Irregularity per Agency ) (edited)
7. Causation = if time latency (Correlation)
