# Per Agency
- Direct Plot =  Frequency~t
- Trend = Linear regress (Direct Plot )
- Seasonality = Sine Cosine regress (Direct Plot )
- Noise = Direct Plot/ (Trend * Seasonality)
- Irregularity = outliers in Noise

# Inter Agency
- Correlation = correlation (time of Irregularity per Agency ) (edited)
- Causation = if time latency (Correlation)
